Smart Traffic Management System Simulation
Overview
This project is a dynamic web-based simulation of a four-way traffic intersection. The system uses a smart algorithm to manage traffic flow by prioritizing the road with the longest queue of vehicles. It provides a visual representation of how a real-world smart traffic system would operate to reduce congestion.

Features
Dynamic Traffic Light Control: Traffic lights automatically change based on the real-time number of cars waiting at each intersection.

Real-time Metrics: The simulation displays the number of vehicles in the queue for each of the four roads (North, South, East, and West).

Interactive Controls: Users can start, pause, and stop the simulation. You can also manually add new vehicles to any of the roads to see how the system adapts.

Single-File Simplicity: The entire project is contained within a single smart_traffic_system.html file, which includes all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This makes it easy to run by simply opening the file in a web browser.

How to Run
Ensure you have a modern web browser and an internet connection.

Open the smart_traffic_system.html file in your browser.

The simulation will start automatically.

Controls
Start Simulation: Begins the traffic flow and light cycles.

Pause/Resume Simulation: Pauses the simulation and resumes it from the same point.

Stop Simulation: Resets the simulation, clearing all vehicles and queues.

Add Vehicle: Adds a new vehicle to the selected road to test the system's responsiveness.s
